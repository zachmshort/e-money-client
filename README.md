# E-Money

Monopoly is an exploration of the natural tendencies of free-market capitalism in the absence of a central bank or government intervention. While playing this fascinating game with a few friends, laughing as we threw money at each other and toppled houses as the pieces glided along the board, I thought of the importance of fiat currency and its utility in our world. Without Monopoly's colorful bills, we would be bargaining with cans of beer, sweaters, or chickens. But one issue arose that once again conveyed a suprisingly profound notion to me, we were roughly 5 hours into the game, and my friend passed go and stretched out his hand, nearly grabbing my face in demand of his $200. As the banker, my hand instictively drifted toward the bill holders reaching for 2 $100 bills. But when I reached over and felt empty space, I looked over in astonishment, we had so much money in game that we forced a bank run. This game session inspired the creation of E-Money, a tool that highlights the importance of liquidity and resource management.
